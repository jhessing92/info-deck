## **SLIDE 1: Own Your AI. ROI in Weeks.**

### **Opening [45 seconds]**

*[Pause as slide loads, let the visuals sink in]*

**Script:**

"Good morning/afternoon. I'm [Your Name] from ShooflyAI.

*[Gesture to screen]*

**'Own your AI. ROI in weeks.'**

That's not marketing speak. That's our promise. In the next 20 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how we deliver on both of those claims.

Here's what you need to know upfront: We're not building chatbots. We're not selling SaaS subscriptions. We're building **applied AI infrastructure** that you own, control, and can take with you—forever.

*[Lean forward]*

Every organization we work with has the same problem: You're drowning in manual workflows, disconnected tools, and data silos. You're spending hours on tasks that should take minutes. And you're using AI tools that create more vendor lock-in, not less.

Today, I'm going to show you a different path. One where you own your intelligence. Where ROI happens in weeks, not years. And where you're never trapped by a vendor.

Let's start with why this matters right now."

*[Advance to next slide]*

---

## **SLIDE 2: Why Now**

### **The Market Moment [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Let me tell you why this is the perfect moment to own your AI infrastructure.

*[Point to first card]*

**AI is affordable now.** 

Here's what changed: The technology that used to cost $10,000 a month is now available at new prices. We're talking about old tech—proven, reliable tech—at dramatically lower costs. That means you can finally **own the stack** instead of renting agents.

*[Point to second card]*

**Owning beats renting.**

Every platform agent out there—ChatGPT, Claude, Microsoft Copilot—they all lock you in. You train their models. You feed their data. And when you want to leave? You start over.

With Shoofly, you own your infrastructure. You keep control forever. Your data stays yours. Your workflows stay yours. Your intelligence stays yours.

*[Point to third card]*

**Portable data & skills.**

This is huge. When you build with us, you're not just buying a tool. You're building capabilities that travel with you. Your playbooks, your model choices, your customizations—they're all portable. You never lose what you build.

*[Pause]*

So the question isn't 'Can we afford to do this?' The question is: 'Can we afford NOT to own our AI infrastructure?'

The answer is no. Not anymore."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 3: What 'Own Your AI' Means**

### **The Core Concept [2.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now let me explain what 'own your AI' actually means in practice.

*[Point to visual]*

This is **Shoofly Intelligence Cloud**—or SIC for short. It's your owned, managed AI brain.

*[Gesture to the visual]*

Look at this. You see a central brain connected to your tools—databases, APIs, workflows, everything. This isn't a metaphor. This is your actual architecture.

*[Point to left side]*

Here's what that means:

**Shoofly Intelligence Cloud is your owned, managed AI brain.**

It connects the tools you already use—your CRMs, your project management tools, your databases—so agents, assistants, and automations work across your entire organization. Not in silos. Across everything.

*[Point to key points]*

And here's the critical part: **You keep the keys and the data.** We can run it, or we can hand it over anytime. No lock-in. No vendor dependency.

*[Point to tags]*

Look at these guarantees:
- **Your data stays yours** — We're not training public models with your content
- **Access is controlled** — RBAC, SSO, enterprise-grade security
- **Full traceability** — Every action logged, every decision auditable
- **SOC 2 Aligned** — We meet enterprise security standards

*[Pause]*

This is the difference between renting and owning. When you rent, you're trapped. When you own, you're free."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 4: What We Build**

### **The Product Suite [3 minutes]**

**Script:**

"So what exactly do we build? Three core products that work together:

*[Point to Automations card]*

**First: Automations.**

Think of these as your 'if-this-then-that' workflows, but smarter. When X happens, Y is done across your tools—automatically.

*[Point to examples]*

- Doc chase: When a document is missing, the system finds it and notifies the right person
- Status sync: When a status changes in one tool, it updates everywhere
- Reconciliation: Nightly reconciliation across systems without manual work

These aren't simple Zapier workflows. These are intelligent automations that understand context, learn patterns, and improve over time.

*[Point to Assistants card]*

**Second: Assistants.**

This is where it gets interesting. **'Ask and act in natural language. Talk to your data.'**

*[Point to example]*

You don't learn a new interface. You just ask: 'Show me Q4 performance' and answers appear instantly. 

But here's what makes it powerful: It's not just answering questions. It's taking actions. 'Draft a campaign brief for Virtual Academy' → Done. 'Summarize today's social sentiment' → Done. 'Show top 5 schools by engagement' → Done.

It's natural language. Zero learning curve. Maximum power.

*[Point to AI Agents card]*

**Third: AI Agents.**

These are your virtual employees. They have memory. They have permissions. They follow SOPs.

*[Point to capabilities]*

- They watch for events and recall context
- They take approved actions across tools
- They follow standard operating procedures, escalate when needed, log every step

Think of them as your 24/7 team members who never get tired, never forget, and never make mistakes.

*[Point to footer flow]*

And here's the beautiful part: These three products all connect through **Shoofly Intelligence Cloud** to create your **Agentic Operating System**.

Plus, you get a **Custom Dashboard**—your window into everything. Automations, Assistants, Agents—all visible, all controllable, all auditable. Included free with every OS Foundation.

*[Pause]*

This is what we build. Not one tool. A complete operating system."

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 5: Outcomes We Deliver**

### **The Value Proposition [3 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now let's talk about what this actually delivers for your team.

*[Point to ROI Calculator button]*

Before I dive in, I want to mention something: We have an interactive ROI calculator built into this slide. If you want to see how these outcomes translate into dollars for your specific team, we can open that up. But let me walk you through the outcomes first.

*[Point to outcomes list]*

**Hours back: 20+ hrs/week**

This isn't incremental. This is transformational. Campaign planning that used to take 4 hours now takes 1. That's 75% time savings, right there.

**Faster execution: Minutes not days**

Brief generation? Instant. Report creation? Instant. Data queries? Instant. You're not waiting anymore. You're executing.

**One source of truth: 100% accuracy**

All your systems synced in real-time. No more data conflicts. No more manual reconciliation. Everything connected. Everything accurate.

**Ask anything: Natural language**

Zero learning curve. Your team talks to the system like they'd talk to a colleague. 'Show Q4 performance' → done. No training. No documentation. Just natural conversation.

**Single-pane control: One dashboard**

Search, trigger actions, track results—all in one place. Your custom dashboard is your command center.

*[Point to dashboard mockup]*

And here's what that dashboard looks like. You can see:

- Active workflows running
- Queries processed today
- Agents monitoring your systems
- Real-time metrics
- Ask, Act, and Audit capabilities—all in one interface

*[If asked about ROI calculator]*

"Would you like me to open the ROI calculator? We can plug in your team size, hourly rates, and hours saved to see exactly what this means in dollars."

*[Pause]*

The bottom line: You're getting time back. Time to focus on strategy. Time to build relationships. Time to do the work that matters."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 6: Your Custom Dashboard — the Control Plane**

### **The Command Center [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Let me show you what your custom dashboard actually looks like.

*[Point to dashboard]*

This is your control plane. One window across all your tools to see, ask, and act in real time.

*[Point to top row]*

**Top row: Your three products**

- **Automation**: See your active workflows, their status, their performance
- **Assistant**: Track queries, see what's being asked, monitor usage
- **Agent**: Watch your agents monitoring systems, see what they're catching

*[Point to bottom row]*

**Bottom row: Three core capabilities**

- **Ask**: Plain-English queries → answers appear instantly
- **Act**: One-click actions and approvals
- **Audit**: Role-based access control, logs, export anytime

*[Point to footer]*

All powered by Shoofly Intelligence Cloud—your owned, managed AI brain.

*[Pause]*

This dashboard isn't optional. It's included with every OS Foundation. It's your window into everything. Your command center. Your single source of truth.

And here's what makes it special: It's YOUR dashboard. We can hand it over anytime. You own the schema. You own the widgets. You own the data.

This is what ownership looks like."

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 7: Two Clear Ways In**

### **The Entry Paths [2.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now, I know what you're thinking: 'This sounds great, but where do we start?'

We've made it simple. Two clear paths:

*[Point to Advisory-First card]*

**Path 1: Advisory-First**

Perfect if you want to explore before committing. Here's what you get:

- 90-minute working session this week
- We map your KPIs and build your backlog
- Optional co-build webinar for your team
- Then you ladder to pilot or OS

This is the discovery path. Low risk. High insight. Perfect for teams who want to understand the full picture before diving in.

*[Point to Pilot-First card]*

**Path 2: Pilot-First**

Perfect if you're ready to prove value fast. Here's what you get:

- 30-day Proof-of-Value
- Or 'Free 1 Workflow' for qualified teams
- Then upgrade to paid pilot
- Ladder to Sprint → OS Foundation

This is the action path. Ship value in 30 days. Prove ROI. Then decide on next steps.

*[Point to footer]*

And here's the progression: **Pilot → Sprint → OS Foundation**

You're never locked in. You're always moving forward. Every step builds on the last.

*[Pause]*

Which path fits your team? Are you exploring or ready to prove value?"

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 8: Proof & Vertical Wedges**

### **Social Proof [2.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now let me show you who's already using this and what they're achieving.

*[Point to K-12 card]*

**K-12 Education**

We're working with a major school district—112 schools, one unified voice.

*[Point to features]*

- 'Ask your dashboard' to review social at scale
- 112 schools monitored in real-time
- **10× capacity increase**

*[Point to KPI]*

**18 hours saved this week.** That's 18 hours the communications team got back. Hours they can spend on strategy instead of manual monitoring.

*[Point to product tags]*

Built with Assistant + SIC, and it's all visible in their custom dashboard.

*[Point to CPA card]*

**CPA Firms**

Accounting firms using our automations for:

- Smart routing and status sync
- Nightly reconciliation
- Phase 2: 1099-K monitor + IRS MeF readiness

*[Point to KPI]*

**6 hours saved this week**—and that's just from the first workflow.

*[Point to Content Engine card]*

**Content Engine**

A content marketing agency seeing:

- **730% ROI in 4 months**
- **>20 hrs/week saved**
- From research to multi-format publishing—all automated

*[Point to KPI]*

**22 hours saved this week.**

*[Pause]*

Three different industries. Three different use cases. All seeing ROI in weeks, not years.

These aren't hypotheticals. These are real results from real teams using our system right now."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 9: 30-Day Launch Plan**

### **The Timeline [3 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now let's talk about how we actually deliver this. Our 30-day launch plan.

*[Point to headline]*

**'Ship value in 7 days. Prove ROI by Day 30.'**

That's not aspirational. That's our commitment.

*[Point to progress rail]*

**Week 1: Go/No-Go**

This is where we prove we can deliver. Here's what happens:

- Kickoff call
- Connect your tools
- Align on KPIs
- **Ship working dashboard**

*[Point to Week 1 deliverables]*

By Day 7, you have:
- 2-3 KPI cards
- Ask box functional
- 1 approval action working
- Baseline captured (hours, cycle time, errors)
- Guardrails on (RBAC/SSO, encrypted, audit logs)

*[Point to client tasks]*

And you're responsible for:
- Naming a champion
- Granting read-only access
- Providing SOP for 1 workflow

That's it. Three simple tasks. We do the rest.

*[Point to Week 2-3]*

**Week 2-3: Build & Iterate**

- Ship first workflow by Day 10-12
- Office Hours Day 7 & 21
- Iterate and expand
- Complete Success Checklist by Day 21 to unlock pilot credit

*[Point to Week 4]*

**Week 4: Review & Next Steps**

- Day-30 Usage & ROI Report
- Compare to baseline
- Decide: Sprint or OS Foundation?

*[Point to guarantee chip]*

And here's our guarantee: **Miss KPI? We keep working or pro-rate refund.**

*[Point to risk management]*

Plus, we build systems that work even when AI doesn't. 99% confidence filtering. Automatic fallback models. Proactive monitoring. Human-in-the-loop governance every step of the way.

*[Pause]*

This isn't a 6-month implementation. This is 30 days. Seven days to value. Thirty days to ROI."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 10: Guarantee + Ownership**

### **The Promise [2.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now let's talk about guarantees and ownership—the two things that make us different.

*[Point to Guarantee card]*

**30-Day PoV Guarantee**

**'We will optimize for free until you do.'**

Hit your KPI or we keep working at no extra cost. That's not a marketing promise. That's our business model.

If you don't see ROI in 30 days, we don't walk away. We keep optimizing. We keep iterating. We keep working until you hit your numbers.

*[Point to Ownership card]*

**You Own It**

- You own code and artifacts
- Optional handoff from managed cloud
- No vendor lock-in, ever

*[Point to dashboard ownership]*

**You own the dashboard schema and widgets.** We host it, or hand it off on request.

*[Point to restaurant metaphor]*

Here's how I like to think about it: **'You own the restaurant; we run the kitchen.'**

Replace us anytime and keep everything. Handoff available. You're never trapped.

*[Point to pricing]*

**Simple, Transparent Pricing:**

- **PoV**: $4,999 one-time
- **Sprint**: $9,999 one-time  
- **OS Foundation**: $25K+ from

No hidden fees. No monthly subscriptions for the core product. You pay once. You own forever.

*[Pause]*

This is the difference between renting and owning. When you rent, you're trapped. When you own, you're free."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 11: Decide Now**

### **The Close [3 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Alright, let's talk about next steps. We've covered a lot today. Let me simplify it to three paths:

*[Point to Advisory-First card]*

**Path 1: Advisory-First**

90-minute working session this week. We map your KPIs, build your backlog, and give you the full picture. Then you decide: pilot or OS.

*[Point to Pilot-First card]*

**Path 2: Pilot-First**

Start today with a 30-day PoV. KPI guarantee. Upgrade path to Sprint or OS Foundation.

*[Point to Ready to Go Agentic card]*

**Path 3: Ready to Go Agentic**

Deploy full OS Foundation. Complete Agentic OS. Custom dashboard plus all products.

*[Point to confirmation box]*

**But regardless of which path you choose, we need to confirm four things:**

1. **KPI**: What does success look like for you?
2. **Tools**: What are we connecting to?
3. **Start Date**: When do we kick off?
4. **Payment**: Invoice and terms

*[Pause, make eye contact]*

Here's what I want you to remember:

- You're not buying software. You're buying infrastructure you own.
- ROI happens in weeks, not years.
- You're never trapped by a vendor.
- We guarantee results or we keep working.

*[Lean forward]*

So here's my question: Which path makes sense for your team? Are you exploring, ready to prove value, or ready to go all-in?

*[Wait for response]*

Great. Let's talk specifics. What's your biggest pain point right now? What's the one workflow that, if automated, would give you the most time back?

*[Engage in conversation, gather requirements]*

Perfect. Let me summarize what I'm hearing:

- [Restate their pain points]
- [Restate their goals]
- [Restate their timeline]

Does that sound right?

*[Confirm]*

Excellent. Here's what I propose:

[Present specific next steps based on their path]

Does that work for you? Can we lock in a start date?"

*[Close for commitment]*

## 📝 **Q&A Preparation**

### **Anticipated Questions & Suggested Answers:**

**Q: "How is this different from ChatGPT or Claude?"**
**A:** "Great question. Three key differences: 1) You own it—your data, your models, your infrastructure. 2) It integrates with YOUR tools—not just chat, but your CRM, your project management, your databases. 3) It's built for work—not conversation, but actual workflow automation. ChatGPT answers questions. Shoofly takes actions."

**Q: "What if the AI makes a mistake?"**
**A:** "We build with humans in the loop. AI generates first drafts, automations require approval, and agents escalate when uncertain. Plus, we use 99% confidence filtering and automatic fallback models. The system is designed to be safe, not perfect."

**Q: "Can we start with just one workflow?"**
**A:** "Absolutely. That's exactly what our Pilot-First path is designed for. Start with one workflow. Prove value. Then expand. Many teams start with a single automation and grow from there."

**Q: "What happens after 30 days?"**
**A:** "You have three options: 1) Upgrade to Sprint for more workflows. 2) Go all-in with OS Foundation. 3) Take what we've built and run it yourself. We hand it over. No strings attached."

**Q: "What if we want to switch vendors later?"**
**A:** "You own everything. Code, artifacts, dashboard schema, workflows. Switch vendors anytime. Take it all with you. We're not a vendor lock-in company. We're an ownership company."

**Q: "What about security and compliance?"**
**A:** "SOC 2 aligned. RBAC and SSO. Encrypted data. Full audit logs. Enterprise-grade security from day one. Your data stays yours. Your access is controlled. Your compliance is guaranteed."

**Q: "How long does onboarding take?"**
**A:** "Seven days to working dashboard. Thirty days to proven ROI. After that, it's iterative expansion. Most teams are fully operational within 60 days."

**Q: "What's included in the pricing?"**
**A:** "PoV includes one workflow, dashboard, and 30-day guarantee. Sprint includes multiple workflows and expanded capabilities. OS Foundation includes everything—all products, custom dashboard, full automation suite. Plus, you own it all."

---

## 🎯 **Key Talking Points to Remember**

4. **"No vendor lock-in"** — Ever
5. **"Start small → Prove value → Scale forever"** — Clear progression path
6. **"Time back"** — ROI measured in hours saved, not just dollars
7. **"SOC 2 aligned"** — Enterprise security from day one

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

**During the Presentation:**

- **Pause after key slides** — Let them absorb the information
- **Ask questions** — "What does this look like for your team?" "What's your biggest pain point?"
- **Use their language** — Mirror their terminology and concerns
- **Tell stories** — Share specific examples from other clients
- **Address objections immediately** — Don't let concerns fester

**Handling Objections:**

- **"We already have AI tools"** → "Perfect. Shoofly connects to those tools. We're not replacing them. We're orchestrating them."
- **"We're not ready for this"** → "That's why we have Advisory-First. Let's explore together. No commitment."
- **"It's too expensive"** → "Let's run the ROI calculator. Show me your team size and hourly rates. I'll show you the payback period."
- **"We've been burned by vendors before"** → "That's exactly why we built ownership into our model. You own everything. No vendor lock-in. Ever."

**Closing Techniques:**

- **Assumptive close**: "So we're looking at starting Week 1, right?"
- **Alternative close**: "Are you leaning toward Advisory-First or Pilot-First?"
- **Urgency close**: "We have capacity for two more 30-day PoVs this month. Should we lock in your spot?"
- **Summary close**: "So just to confirm: KPI is [X], we're connecting [Y], and we start [Date]. Sound right?"

---

**Remember: You're not selling software. You're offering transformation. Ownership. Freedom. ROI in weeks.**

**Good luck! You've got this.** 🚀
