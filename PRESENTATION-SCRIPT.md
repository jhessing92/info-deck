## **SLIDE 1: One System to Tell More Stories**

### **Opening [30 seconds]**

*[Pause as slide loads, let the visuals sink in]*

**Script:**

"Good morning/afternoon everyone. Thank you for being here.

What you're looking at isn't just a technology presentation—it's a fundamental shift in how CCSD tells stories. 

*[Gesture to screen]*

**One System to Tell More Stories.** That's our mission. That's what we're here to talk about today.

Right now, your communications team says 'no' to most school stories—not because they don't care, but because there simply aren't enough hours in the day. 

Today, I'm going to show you how we change that—how we empower CCSD to say 'yes' to stories from all 112 schools across the district.

This is Georgia's first agentic marketing ecosystem. And it's being built specifically for you."

*[Advance to next slide]*

## **SLIDE 2: Why Now**

### **The Problem Statement [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Let me start with something Daniel Vehar said that really stuck with me:

*[Read quote on screen]*

**'Our ROI is time.'**

That's profound. Because for most organizations, ROI means revenue. But for CCSD, ROI means something different—it means getting time back. Time to tell more stories. Time to say yes instead of no.

*[Pause]*

Here's the reality: Your communications team receives 5 to 10 story requests per day from schools. And right now, most of those requests get ignored—not because they're not important, but because there's simply no bandwidth.

*[Lean forward]*

That's what we're solving. We're building an agentic operating system that acts as your team's virtual newsroom—a 24/7 creative partner that handles the heavy lifting so your team can focus on strategy, relationships, and the stories that matter most.

The question isn't 'Can we build this?' The question is: 'Can we afford NOT to?'"

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 3: Vision - One System, Many Voices**

### **The Big Picture [1.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"So what does this look like in practice?

*[Read quote on screen]*

**'From a central hub, every school can publish, measure, and celebrate their stories.'**

This is the vision. Not a bunch of disconnected tools. Not more spreadsheets. Not another platform to learn.

*[Point to three pillars]*

One unified workspace where everything connects:
- A **unified workspace** where campaigns live and breathe
- A **shared knowledge base** that learns your voice and never forgets it
- **Connected dashboards** that show you what's working in real-time

It's one system, but it amplifies many voices—112 voices, to be exact. Every school. Every story. All connected."

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 4: Pain to Possibility**

### **Contrast the Reality [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Let's talk about where you are today versus where you could be.

*[Point to 'Before' column]*

**Before:** This is the current reality for most communications teams—and I'm guessing it feels familiar:

- Manual writing and ideation for every single piece
- 5 to 10 school requests coming in daily that get ignored
- Half-day campaign briefs that take a director away from strategy
- Fragmented systems—ClickUp for tasks, Sprout for social, Brand24 for monitoring—none of them talking to each other

*[Pause, let it sink in]*

Now look at the other side.

*[Point to 'After' column]*

**After:** This is what becomes possible:

- AI-driven ideation and brief generation—ideas at the speed of conversation
- Agent-run reporting and sentiment alerts—you wake up to insights, not data
- First-draft automation—your writers become editors, not content factories
- And here's the key: **One chat to orchestrate it all**

You go from saying 'no' to saying 'yes.' From reactive to proactive. From overwhelmed to in control."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 5: Chat-Driven OS Interface**

### **The Revolutionary UX [2.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now I want to show you something that's going to change how you think about AI.

*[Point to chat interface]*

This is the Chat OS. Every agent, every capability, every insight—accessible through one conversation.

*[Wait for animation to play]*

Watch what happens when someone types: **'Draft a campaign brief for Virtual Academy.'**

*[Let AI response appear]*

Look at that. In seconds, the system generates:
- A complete campaign structure
- Clear objectives
- A three-week timeline
- A tone check to ensure it's on-brand
- And it syncs automatically to ClickUp

*[Pause]*

This isn't a chatbot that answers questions. This is a **conversational operating system** that does work.

You don't need to learn new interfaces. You don't need to click through five screens. You just ask—naturally, like you would a colleague—and it delivers.

*[Point to benefits on right]*

- **Natural conversation** - Talk to your OS like a team member
- **Instant action** - From idea to structured brief in seconds
- **Always on brand** - Built-in tone and policy compliance

This is what makes our system different. It's not about replacing humans—it's about giving humans superpowers."

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 6: Your Agentic Team**

### **The Six Agents [3 minutes]**

**Script:**

"So let's meet your team. These are the six intelligent agents that power the OS—and more importantly, what they free your human team to do.

*[Point to each card as you discuss]*

**1. Campaign Planner**
- Generates full briefs and timelines
- **Human lens:** Frees directors to focus on strategy instead of paperwork

**2. Social Media Manager**
- Monitors sentiment and performance across all platforms
- **Human lens:** Keeps your pulse on all 112 communities—something no human could do manually

**3. Blog Builder**
- Writes first drafts and optimizes for SEO
- **Human lens:** Your writers become editors—they refine instead of create from scratch

**4. Accreditation + Analytics**
- Monitors reputation and policy compliance 24/7
- **Human lens:** Protects your district's narrative before issues become crises

**5. Dashboard**
- Tracks ROI and engagement in real-time
- **Human lens:** Delivers clarity to leadership—no more scrambling for reports

**6. Knowledge Base**
- Stores tone, brand guidelines, and templates
- **Human lens:** Learns CCSD's voice over time—institutional knowledge that never walks out the door

*[Pause]*

These aren't just tools. They're team members. And they work 24/7 so your human team can focus on what they do best: building relationships, making strategic decisions, and telling the stories that matter."

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 7: The Chat OS Experience**

### **See It In Action [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Let me show you what this looks like in a real workflow.

*[Point to conversation]*

Here's a comms lead talking to the Marketing OS just like they would talk to a colleague:

**Comms Lead asks:** 'Show me sentiment trends for our recent equity campaign.'

*[Point to AI response]*

**The OS responds** with a complete analysis:
- 82% positive engagement
- Top performer: Harrison High School  
- And here's the key: it makes a recommendation—'Amplify student voice content'

Then the comms lead says: **'Create a follow-up campaign brief.'**

And the OS does it. Instantly.

*[Point to 'Ask it anything' examples]*

This is what I mean by conversational power:
- 'Summarize today's social sentiment'
- 'Show top 5 schools by engagement'
- 'Draft tomorrow's Breast Cancer Awareness post'

You're not navigating menus. You're not clicking buttons. You're just talking—and the system responds with intelligence."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 8: Agent Workflows**

### **The Efficiency Gains [1.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Let's talk about what these agents actually accomplish in your workflow.

*[Point to each workflow card]*

**Campaign Planner:** 75% time savings on campaign setup
- What used to take 4 hours now takes 1

**Social Manager:** Real-time sentiment monitoring plus post QA
- You're not just publishing—you're publishing smart

**Content Ideation:** Turns one blog into five social assets
- Maximum reach from minimum effort

**Reporting:** Auto-generates weekly executive reports
- No more Sunday nights building PowerPoints

*[Point to workflow wheel]*

And here's the beautiful part: The workflow becomes **Edit, Approve, Publish.**

You're not writing from scratch. You're not researching for hours. You're reviewing, refining, and releasing. That's the new workflow."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 9: ROI Snapshot**

### **The Numbers [2.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now let's talk about ROI. And remember—for CCSD, ROI isn't measured in dollars. It's measured in time and stories.

*[Point to each metric row]*

Let me break this down:

**Campaign setup:**
- Current: 4 hours per campaign
- With AI OS: 1 hour
- **Impact: 75% time saved**

**Writing:**
- Current: 1 hour per piece
- With AI OS: 30 minutes (you're editing, not creating)
- **Impact: 25-30% time saved**

**Ideation research:**
- Current: 3 hours per day digging for story ideas
- With AI OS: 1 hour reviewing AI-generated ideas
- **Impact: 65% time saved**

**And here's the big one—Stories published:**
- Current: 10 stories per day (maybe)
- With AI OS: **112 stories per week potential**
- **Impact: 10× capacity increase**

*[Let that sink in]*

That's not 10% more. Not 50% more. That's **TEN TIMES** more stories. That's every school getting a story every week.

*[Point to payback metric]*

**Directional payback: About 4.5 months.**

Now, these figures depend on adoption and data quality—but even at half this efficiency, the ROI is undeniable."

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 10: Knowledge + Memory Layer**

### **Owning Your Intelligence [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now I want to talk about something critically important: **data ownership.**

*[Read quote on screen]*

**'Owning your intelligence means never losing your voice.'**

Here's what that means:

Every campaign you run, every brief you create, every edit you make—it's training a private model. YOUR model. Not OpenAI's. Not Google's. Yours.

*[Point to neural network visual]*

This is your institutional knowledge visualized:
- Your **voice**
- Your **tone**
- Your **templates**
- Your **brand guidelines**

*[Pause]*

You know what happens at most organizations when a senior communications person leaves? They take a decade of knowledge with them. Stories that worked. Language that resonated. Relationships that mattered.

Not anymore.

*[Point to features]*

With this system:
- Every campaign makes the system smarter
- Pattern recognition improves over time
- Optional GetPoppy API integration for personalized writing memory
- You never lose institutional knowledge when team members change

This is your intelligence. You own it. You control it. And it grows with you."

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 11: Marketing Performance Dashboard**

### **Intelligence at Your Fingertips [1.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"So how do you actually see what's working?

*[Point to dashboard metrics]*

This isn't just a dashboard—it's a conversational analytics advisor.

Look at these metrics updating in real-time:
- **Engagement Rate:** 8.4% (up 24%)
- **Campaign Reach:** 2.1 million (up 37%)
- **Stories Published:** 112 per week (up 900%)

*[Point to chat example]*

But here's what makes it special—you can just ask:

**'Show sentiment trends for Harrison High last 30 days.'**

And it shows you. No clicking through filters. No building custom reports. Just ask.

This pulls data from Sprout Social, Brand24, ClickUp—all your systems—and makes it conversational.

Leadership wants to know what's working? You can tell them. Right now. With confidence."

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 12: School-Level Story Expansion**

### **The 112 Goal [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now we get to the heart of why we're doing this.

*[Point to strategic goal]*

**'One story per school per week.'**

That's the goal. 112 schools. 112 stories. Every single week.

Right now, that's impossible. Literally impossible. There aren't enough hours, enough people, enough resources.

*[Point to map visualization]*

But watch what happens with AI-enabled micro-storytelling.

*[Let animation play - schools lighting up]*

Every dot you see is a school getting its story told. Every light is a principal who no longer has to feel invisible. Every pulse is a community being celebrated.

*[Point to impact metric]*

**500% increase in storytelling capacity.**

Not 50%. Not 100%. **Five hundred percent.**

That's the difference between saying 'no' and saying 'yes.' Between featuring the same 10 schools and celebrating all 112."

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 13: Implementation Timeline**

### **How We Get There [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"So how do we actually build this? Let me walk you through the 10-week timeline.

*[Point to each phase]*

**Weeks 1-2: Discovery + Integrations**
- We connect to your APIs—ClickUp, Sprout, Brand24
- Map your existing workflows
- Run team workshops to understand your needs

**Weeks 3-5: Agent Builds**

*[Pause]*

Ten weeks from kickoff to launch. And we're with you every step of the way."

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 14: Investment & ROI**

### **The Financial Case [2.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Let's talk about investment. I know this is what everyone wants to know.

*[Point to investment column]*

**One-time build: $25,000 to $35,000**
- This covers the complete system build, all integrations, training, everything

**Monthly operating: About $400**
- This is API costs and maintenance—that's it

*[Point to ROI column]*

Now here's what you get back:

**First Year ROI: 400 to 500%**

Let me break that down:
- **Labor value saved: About $79,000 per year**
- **Payback period: 4.5 months**

*[Read narrative framing]*

But remember what Daniel said: **'Measured not in revenue, but in stories told per dollar.'**

*[Pause, make eye contact]*

Think about it this way: For the cost of one mid-level hire, you're getting the equivalent of a team of six specialists working 24/7. 

And unlike a hire, they never get sick, never take vacation, never leave for another job.

Plus, you're not just buying software—you're buying capacity. The capacity to say yes. The capacity to tell 10 times more stories. The capacity to give every school in your district a voice."

## **SLIDE 15: Success Metrics**

### **How We Measure Success [1.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"So how do we know if this is working? Let me show you the four key metrics we'll be tracking.

*[Point to each metric]*

**Story Output:**
- Goal: Schools covered weekly
- Target: All 112 schools
- This is the north star metric

**Campaign Setup:**
- Goal: Time reduction
- Target: 75% faster
- From hours to minutes

**Reporting:**
- Goal: Manual hours saved
- Target: 80% reduction
- No more weekend report building

**Sentiment Visibility:**
- Goal: Channels monitored
- Target: 100% coverage
- Nothing falls through the cracks

These aren't aspirational. These are achievable targets based on proven AI capabilities and your team's commitment."

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 16: Strategic Impact**

### **The Bigger Picture [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Let me zoom out for a moment and talk about what this really means.

*[Read headline]*

**'CCSD sets a new standard for educational storytelling.'**

This isn't just about CCSD. This is about leadership.

*[Point to each impact statement]*

- You'll be the **first district in Georgia** with an agentic marketing OS
- Your **time ROI converts into communication reach**—more stories, more visibility, more pride
- You'll be **media-ready for GSPRA and national coverage**

*[Pause]*

Think about the story you'll tell at GSPRA:

'We were drowning in requests and saying no to 90% of our schools. Then we built an AI operating system that let us say yes. Now every school gets a story every week. Here's how we did it.'

*[Point to impact stats]*

- **112 schools connected**
- **10× capacity increase**
- **4.5-month payback**

That's not an incremental improvement. That's transformation. And you get to lead it."

## **SLIDE 17: The Future OS - Closing**

### **The Close [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

*[Let the chat bubble animation play]*

*[Read the AI message]*

**'Hi, I'm your CCSD Marketing OS. What should we create today?'**

*[Pause, smile]*

That's the question your team will be asking tomorrow—not 'What can we say no to?' but 'What should we create today?'

*[Point to prepared by section]*

We're ShooflyAI. We build applied AI infrastructure for public institutions. 

We've already proven this works with CCSD:
- Calls with Santa: 100K impressions, 62% open rate
- Social Media Scraper: 112 schools monitored

We know your district. We know your challenges. And we know how to solve them.

*[Final call to action]*

**Ready to tell more stories?**

*[Pause, make eye contact with key decision makers]*

Let's talk about next steps. I'm ready to answer your questions, discuss customizations, and map out what implementation looks like specifically for CCSD.

Thank you."

*[End of presentation - open for Q&A]*

## 📝 **Q&A Preparation**

### **Anticipated Questions & Suggested Answers:**

**Q: "What if the AI makes a mistake?"**
**A:** "Great question. The system is designed with humans in the loop. AI generates first drafts and ideas—your team reviews, refines, and approves before anything goes public. Think of it as a very smart intern who needs supervision."

**Q: "How do we train staff on this?"**
**A:** "Training is included in the build fee. We run hands-on workshops during Weeks 1-2 and again at launch. Plus, the chat interface is intuitive—if you can text, you can use this system."

**Q: "What about data privacy and security?"**
**A:** "All data stays within your controlled environment. We're not training public models with your content. Your stories, your tone, your knowledge—it's all private and owned by CCSD."

**Q: "Can we start with just one or two agents?"**
**A:** "We recommend the full ecosystem because the agents work together—but yes, we can phase implementation if budget is a concern. The Campaign Planner and Social Manager deliver immediate value."

**Q: "What happens after the 10-week implementation?"**
**A:** "You'll have a fully operational system. The monthly $400 covers API costs and basic maintenance. We're also available for enhancements, new features, and quarterly strategy reviews."

**Q: "How is this different from just using ChatGPT?"**
**A:** "Three key differences: 1) It's trained on YOUR voice and brand, 2) It integrates with YOUR tools (ClickUp, Sprout, etc.), and 3) It's designed specifically for school district communications, not general-purpose chat."

---

## 🎯 **Key Talking Points to Remember**

**Throughout the presentation, reinforce these themes:**

1. **"Our ROI is time"** - This is about capacity, not cost savings
2. **"Edit, don't write"** - Shift from creation to curation
3. **"Say yes, not no"** - Transform the relationship with schools
4. **"One story per school per week"** - The 112 goal
5. **"First in Georgia"** - Leadership opportunity
6. **"Own your intelligence"** - Data ownership matters
