## **SLIDE 1: Own Your AI. ROI in Weeks.**

### **Opening [45 seconds]**

*[Pause as slide loads, let the visuals sink in]*

**Script:**

"Good morning/afternoon. I'm [Your Name] from ShooflyAI.

*[Gesture to screen]*

**'Own your AI. ROI in weeks.'**

That's not marketing speak. That's our promise.

*[Point to subtitle]*

**'Your AI brain. Your keys. We handle the ops.'**

Here's what that means: We build AI infrastructure that you OWN—your code, your data, your intelligence. But you don't have to operate it. We can run it for you, or hand it off anytime. No vendor lock-in. Ever.

*[Point to footer]*

**Start small → Prove value → Scale forever.**

That's the progression. Let me show you why this matters right now."

*[Advance to next slide]*

---

## **SLIDE 2: The Problem**

### **AI is Everywhere... and Nowhere [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Let me show you the problem with how everyone uses AI today.

*[Point to the brain/body diagram]*

Every tool is adding AI. Fireflies has an AI assistant. HubSpot has an AI assistant. QuickBooks, Monday, Slack—they all have these built-in 'brains.'

Here's the issue: **Each app has a 'brain' (AI assistant) + 'body' (your data).**

*[Point to the isolated brains]*

But those brains can't see across tools. They only know about their own app.

*[Point to callout box]*

Look at this example: **'Ask Fireflies: which deals are closing?'**

It can't answer. Because it can't see your CRM or QuickBooks. Its intelligence is trapped inside the Fireflies app.

*[Pause]*

So you become the integration layer—copying, pasting, reconciling data between systems every day. That's manual glue work.

And the result? **Fragmented intelligence + growing vendor lock-in.**

Your AI capability is trapped inside someone else's product."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 3: What Renting Intelligence Costs You**

### **You Can Export Data... But Not Intelligence [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now let me explain why this vendor lock-in is so dangerous.

*[Point to split-screen visual]*

**You can export data… but you can't export intelligence.**

Look at this:

*[Point to left side - Export Data ✓]*

Vendors let you export records. CSV downloads, API data access, record backups—all good.

*[Point to right side - Export Intelligence ✗]*

But you CAN'T export:
- AI memory & context
- Trained playbooks  
- Custom workflows

*[Point to 'Memory is the moat' callout]*

**Memory is the moat.** That's their competitive advantage. They trap your intelligence so you can't leave.

Switching models means rebuilding context from scratch. All that learning? Gone.

Your 'AI capability' becomes trapped inside someone else's product.

*[Pause]*

That's why ownership matters. When you rent, you're trapped. When you own, you're free."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 4: The Solution in One Sentence**

### **Own the Brain That Connects All Your Tools [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"So here's our solution in one sentence:

*[Read headline]*

**Own the brain that connects all your tools.**

*[Point to SIC badge]*

This is **Shoofly Intelligence Cloud (SIC)**—your owned, managed AI brain.

*[Point to three bullet points]*

Here's what it does:

1. **Connects your apps + databases + workflows** into one intelligence layer
2. **Swap models without losing your playbooks**—use GPT, Claude, Gemini, whatever you want
3. **Feed everything into a custom dashboard**—your single pane of truth

*[Point to diagram at bottom]*

Look at this visual: Tools on the left, SIC in the middle, dashboard on the right.

Everything flows through your owned brain. Nothing is trapped. Nothing is siloed.

*[Pause]*

This is how you break free from vendor lock-in while gaining intelligence across your entire organization."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 5: You Own It. We Operate It.**

### **Ownership Without the Operational Burden [2.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now I know what you're thinking: 'Owning sounds great, but I don't want to manage APIs and infrastructure.'

That's exactly why we operate it for you.

*[Point to two-column layout]*

**Left side—You Own:**
- Code & workflows
- Dashboard schema & widgets
- Intelligence artifacts & playbooks
- Your data—always

**Right side—We Operate:**
- Integrations & API changes
- Security + access controls
- Uptime & monitoring
- Governance & auditability

*[Point to Fireflies example callout]*

Here's a real example: When Fireflies deprecated their V1 API and migrated to V2, we handled the entire migration. **Your workflows never broke.** This is why managed operations matter.

*[Point to handoff badge]*

And here's the key: **Handoff-ready.**

If you get acquired, we package everything up and hand it off. If you want to switch vendors, take it all with you. If you want to bring it in-house, we train your team.

*[Pause]*

You own the restaurant; we run the kitchen. Replace us anytime and keep everything."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 6: Why Now**

### **AI Is Unbundling SaaS [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Let me tell you why this is the perfect moment to own your AI infrastructure.

*[Read headline]*

**What eCommerce did to malls, AI is doing to SaaS.**

*[Point to three cards]*

Here's what changed:

**1. Development is dramatically cheaper and faster now**
- What took months now takes hours
- Internal tools can be built quickly

**2. You can finally 'own the stack'**
- Instead of renting it from vendors
- Custom solutions are now accessible

*[Point to visual: SaaS bundle → modular components]*

The old way: Pay for bundled SaaS with features you don't use.

The new way: Build exactly what you need. Own it. Control it.

*[Pause]*

This is why now is the time. The technology is affordable. The tools are accessible. And ownership is finally within reach."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 7: The Shoofly Method**

### **The 3-Phase Path to an Agentic OS [3 minutes]**

**Script:**

"So how do we actually build AI that ships? Let me walk you through our 3-phase method.

*[Point to three cards]*

**Phase 1: Business Strategy**

This is where 95% of AI pilots fail—they skip this step. We don't.

- Pick KPI(s) to optimize
- Establish baseline metrics
- Define success criteria

If you don't have anything to measure against, you don't have a business strategy—you have a science experiment.

**Phase 2: Data & Systems**

Now we understand where your data lives:

- Map existing tools
- Connect sources of truth
- Set up access controls

This is where we might build automations to get your systems talking to each other.

**Phase 3: Agentic OS**

Finally, we enable AI capabilities:

- Deploy Automations (when X happens → Y happens)
- Add Assistants (ask & act in natural language)
- Launch Agents (always-on workers with memory + permissions)

*[Point to footer]*

**All visible in your Custom Dashboard.**

*[Pause]*

This isn't theory. This is our proven method. Business strategy first. Data second. AI third."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 8: Demo - A Wedge Workflow**

### **Prove Value Fast [2 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Let me show you a real workflow that proves value fast—this is how we start.

*[Point to flow diagram]*

**Trigger:** Meeting ends / doc received / form submitted

**AI Extracts:** Decisions + action items + owners

**One-Click:** Send to CRM / Monday / Slack

**Audit Log:** Log everything for traceability

*[Point to example callout]*

Here's a concrete example:

**Fireflies transcript** → AI extracts action items → **One-click to Monday** with owners & due dates → **Logged for audit**

*[Pause]*

This workflow alone can save you hours every week. And it's just one example.

We start here—with one workflow that moves a needle. Prove value. Then expand."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 9: What We Build**

### **Three Building Blocks. One Operating System. [2.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now that you've seen how we start with one workflow, let me show you the full suite of what we build.

*[Point to three cards]*

**Three building blocks:**

**1. Automations**
- 'When X happens → Y happens' across tools
- Doc chase & status sync
- Nightly reconciliation
- Smart routing & triggers

**2. Assistants**
- 'Ask + Act' in natural language on your data
- 'Show Q4 performance' → done
- 'Draft campaign brief' → done
- Zero learning curve

**3. AI Agents**
- Always-on workers with memory + permissions
- Watch for events & recall context
- Take approved actions
- Follow SOPs, escalate when needed

*[Point to footer with icons]*

**All connected through SIC** (your owned brain) → **surfaced in your Custom Dashboard** (your single pane of truth).

*[Pause]*

This isn't one tool. It's a complete operating system. And you can start with just one workflow—like we just showed—and expand from there."

*[Advance]*

## **SLIDE 10: Proof Across Industries**

### **Real Results (ROI in Weeks) [3 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now let me show you who's already using this and what they're achieving.

*[Point to three cards and read through them]*

**K-12 Social Scoring:**
- Problem: Manual quarterly audit (80 hours)
- Build: Automated crawl + scoring
- Result: **80 hrs → ~2.5 hrs + human review**
- 18 hours saved this week

*[Point to testimonial]*

*[Read Dan Vehar testimonial]*

**CPA Firm Operations:**
- Problem: Owner bottleneck (calls/email)
- Build: DocuSign auto-updates + nightly CRM ↔ QuickBooks reconciliation
- Result: Smart routing + data sync
- 6 hours saved this week

*[Point to testimonial]*

*[Read Kendyl Strickland testimonial]*

**Content Engine:**
- Problem: Manual research to publish
- Build: Automated pipeline
- Result: **730% ROI in 4 months**
- 22 hours saved this week

*[Point to testimonial]*

*[Read Chris Lowe testimonial]*

*[Pause]*

Three different industries. Three different use cases. All seeing ROI in weeks, not years.

These aren't hypotheticals. These are real results from real teams."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 11: The Control Plane**

### **Your Custom Dashboard [2.5 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Let me show you what your custom dashboard actually looks like.

*[Point to dashboard header]*

**Your Command Center.** Custom Dashboard. Single Pane of Truth. Live.

*[Point to 6 widgets]*

Look at these six widgets showing real-time data:

1. **Active Workflows:** 12 running now (↑ 23% vs last week)
2. **Agent Status:** 3/3 operational (all systems green)
3. **Queries Today:** 847 questions answered (peak 2-4pm)
4. **Approvals Queue:** 5 pending review
5. **Time Saved (KPI):** 18 hrs this week (goal: 25 hrs/week)
6. **Audit Log:** 1.2k actions logged

*[Point to Ask, Act, Audit row]*

And here are your three core capabilities:

**Ask:** Plain-English queries over connected systems → instant answers

**Act:** One-click approvals and actions across your entire stack

**Audit:** Role-based access, full logs, export anytime

*[Point to cost lever callout]*

Here's an important benefit: **Reduce seat costs** by shifting daily work into your owned dashboard. Keep only the minimum system-of-record licenses.

*[Point to footer]*

All powered by Shoofly Intelligence Cloud.

*[Pause]*

This dashboard isn't optional. It's included with every OS Foundation. It's your window into everything."

*[Advance]*

---

## **SLIDE 12: 30-Day Launch + Pricing**

### **The Timeline and Investment [3 minutes]**

**Script:**

"Now let's talk about how we deliver this and what it costs.

*[Point to headline]*

**Ship value in 7 days. Prove ROI by Day 30.**

*[Point to timeline on left]*

**Week 1:**
- Connect tools + baseline + ship dashboard

**Week 2-3:**
- Ship first workflows + iterate

**Week 4:**
- ROI review + expansion plan

*[Point to guarantee]*

And here's our guarantee: **We fine-tune at no cost until it works.**

*[Point to pricing on right]*

**Packaging & Pricing:**

**Core Packages:**
- **Proof-of-Value (PoV) Pilot:** $4-8k (30-day validation)
- **Sprint:** $10-18k (Expand workflows + agents)
- **AI OS Foundation:** $25k+ (Full Agentic OS)

**Additional Services:**
- **Advising (monthly):** min $2,500/mo
- **AI Development:** Varies (custom builds)
- **SIC Cloud (managed ops):** $350–2.5k/mo depending on scope

*[Point to CTA at bottom]*

**Pick 1 Workflow → Pick 1 KPI → Pick Start Date**

We need to confirm four things:
- **KPI:** What does success look like?
- **Tools:** What are we connecting?
- **Start Date:** When do we kick off?
- **Payment:** Invoice & terms

*[Pause, make eye contact]*

So here's my question: Which path makes sense for you? Are you ready to prove value with a pilot, or ready to go all-in with the full OS?

*[Wait for response, engage in conversation]*"

*[End of presentation - open for Q&A]*

## 📝 **Q&A Preparation**

### **Anticipated Questions & Suggested Answers:**

**Q: "How is this different from ChatGPT or Claude?"**
**A:** "Three key differences: 1) You own it—your data, your models, your infrastructure. 2) It integrates with YOUR tools—not just chat, but your CRM, your project management, your databases. 3) It's built for work—not conversation, but actual workflow automation."

**Q: "What if the AI makes a mistake?"**
**A:** "We build with humans in the loop. AI generates first drafts, automations require approval, and agents escalate when uncertain. Plus we use 99% confidence filtering and automatic fallback models."

**Q: "Can we start with just one workflow?"**
**A:** "Absolutely. That's exactly what our PoV Pilot is designed for. Start with one workflow. Prove value in 30 days. Then expand."

**Q: "What happens after 30 days?"**
**A:** "You have three options: 1) Upgrade to Sprint for more workflows. 2) Go all-in with OS Foundation. 3) Take what we've built and run it yourself. We hand it over. No strings attached."

**Q: "What if we want to switch vendors later?"**
**A:** "You own everything. Code, artifacts, dashboard schema, workflows. Switch vendors anytime. Take it all with you. We're not a vendor lock-in company. We're an ownership company."

**Q: "What about security and compliance?"**
**A:** "SOC 2 aligned. RBAC and SSO. Encrypted data. Full audit logs. Enterprise-grade security from day one."

**Q: "How does the Fireflies example work exactly?"**
**A:** "Great question—let me explain. Fireflies transcribes your meetings. We can build an automation that takes those transcripts, extracts action items with AI, and sends them to your project management tool like Monday with one click. It saves hours of manual note-taking every week."

**Q: "What's the difference between Automations, Assistants, and Agents?"**
**A:** "Automations are 'if-this-then-that' workflows (when X happens, do Y). Assistants let you ask questions and take actions in natural language. Agents are always-on workers with memory who follow SOPs and escalate when needed. They all work together."

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

**During the Presentation:**

- **Use the brain/body metaphor consistently** — It helps people understand why siloed AI doesn't work
- **Pause after Slide 3** — Let the "memory is the moat" concept sink in
- **Tell the Fireflies story on Slide 9** — Concrete examples land better than abstract concepts
- **Point to live demos on Slide 10** — Offer to click through if they want to see more
- **Address cost concerns proactively** — Talk about seat reduction and time saved, not just sticker price

**Handling Objections:**

- **"We already have AI tools"** → "Perfect. We connect to those tools. We're not replacing them—we're orchestrating them."
- **"We're not ready"** → "That's why we start with one workflow. Prove value in 30 days. Then decide."
- **"It's too expensive"** → "Let's talk about time saved. What's your team's hourly rate? How many hours do you spend on manual workflows weekly?"
- **"We've been burned by vendors"** → "That's exactly why we built ownership into our model. You own everything. No lock-in. Ever."

**Closing Techniques:**

- **Assumptive close**: "So we're looking at starting Week 1, right?"
- **Alternative close**: "Are you leaning toward a PoV Pilot or ready for the full OS?"
- **Urgency close**: "We have capacity for two more 30-day PoVs this month. Should we lock in your spot?"
- **Summary close**: "So just to confirm: KPI is [X], we're connecting [Y], and we start [Date]. Sound right?"

---

**Remember: You're not selling software. You're offering ownership, freedom, and ROI in weeks.**

**Good luck! You've got this.** 🚀
